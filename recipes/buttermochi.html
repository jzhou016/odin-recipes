    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is the ultimate treat for mochi lovers. 
        It combines the perfectly chewy, slightly sticky and dense texture of mochi 
        with a buttery, custard-like flavor of cake, all the while 
        forming a crisp golden crust.
        It is ooey gooey with a hint of coconut, sure to please any crowd.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cups skim milk</li>
        <li>1 pound Mochiko flour</li>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>One 13 1/2 ounce can coconut milk</li>
        <li>Optional: 1/2 cup unsweetend shredded coconut</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Method</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease a 9 by 13-inch baking pan with butter or oil.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, vanilla, and milk. In another larger bowl, whisk together the mochiko, sugar, baking powder, and kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and, with a wooden spoon stir until well combined. 
            Add the melted butter and coconut milk and mix until fully incorporated.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and rap the pan on the counter a couple of times to bring any air bubbles up to the surface.
            If desired, sprinkled the shredded coconut on top lightly.</li>
        <li>Bake until the mochi is set and golden brown on top, about 1 hour. 
            Set the pan on a wire rack and let cool completely before slicing into rectangles using a plastic knife to minimize sticking.</li>
        <li>Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.</li>
    </ol>
