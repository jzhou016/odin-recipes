    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Now, this is not your typical cheesecake. 
        It has only five ingredients, comes together in a food processor, and emerges from the oven jiggly and blackened. 
        It is one of the best things you will ever taste.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>10 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>4 1/2 cups cream cheese, preferably Philadelphia brand, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups creme fraiche</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Method</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475 degrees.</li>
        <li>Spray a 9‚Äù springform cake pan with non-stick spray, and fully line the bottom with parchment paper. </li>
        <li>Using a food processor, cream the sugar, egg yolks, cream cheese, and salt until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the creme fraiche and mix until the batter is fully incorporated. </li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 22-24 minutes or until the top is caramelized, but the middle is still very loose and jiggly. 
            When you move the cheesecake, it should have a wave effect.</li>
        <li>Let the cheesecake come to room temperature on a cooling rack and then refrigerate uncovered overnight.</li>
        <li>Bring to almost room temperature and serve in slices.</li>
    </ol>
